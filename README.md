A restaurant "BISTRO BLISS" webpage frontend using HTML 5, CSS 3 & Bootstrap 5. It consists of a header, a main section, & a menu section. Initially we have a responsive header consisting of a restaurant logo, a navbar and a Booking button.
For large screens:
<img width="1340" height="114" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ebdf562-463e-4c7d-bec1-a8930670be48" />
For medium or small screens:
<img width="394" height="192" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60d6a707-ec7b-48ac-800d-16fc15988c7b" />
Then we have a main section with background image & a centeralized container that is responsive. Moreover, we have a menu section that is responsive as of yet but requires some improvements.
Here is the screenshot for the complete webpage:
